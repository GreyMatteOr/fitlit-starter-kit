# FitLit Fitness and Activity Tracker
A [Mod2 Project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html) by [Matthew Lane](https://github.com/GreyMatteOr) and [Eric Berglund](https://github.com/ericberglund117)

## Overview

This is mock-up for a potential website. It tracks data like daily-steps, water drank, hours of sleep gotten (similar to a fitness tracking watch might) and displays easy to read charts. It also includes a social element, displaying friends latest fitness stats, as well as a section a comparing the user to a theoretical 'average user'.

By default it will display statistics for a random user (from a set of 50 pre-populated examples). It will load their stats from the last week, but the days stats can be changed using the calendar in the top right.

## Setup

Clone down the repo (from your GitHub). If you don't want to name your project "fitlit-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

After this, open your console and navigate to the root directory of the program. Run the command

```bash
npm install
```

to download the necessary dependencies. Finally, Run the command `open index.html` to launch the page in your browser.
